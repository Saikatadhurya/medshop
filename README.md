Then, the user needs to provide some information like personal details, the problem with which he/she is suffering, previous medical records etc. In this step, the customer also has to choose the preferred slot of appointment. To finalize the booking, the customer has to pay a booking charge. After payment, a token will be generated with necessary booking information. Using the 'token status' option, the patient can check the status of the token anytime. According to the sequence number in the token, the patient has to visit the clinic for the checkup.  
In the clinic portal, the list doctor in the clinic with their specialisation and visiting time will be available. Through the 'view patients' option, a list of patients of respective doctors can be viewed according to the date. So that clinic can notify the user if anyone booked and then missed their appointment.
